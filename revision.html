        <p id=pc1> I had my friend Adam take a look at the project for me. He suggested that I include a link in the paragraph to H.H. Holmes' wikipedia. The picture was serving as a link currently but it could be overlooked. There was text link to the Wikipedia for Charles Cullen. </p>

            <div class="text-col"> <p>This is the the before page. The picture of H. H. Holmes was a link to his wikipedia. This might have been overlooked or confusing becaue there is a text link to the other person mentioned Charles Cullen.
