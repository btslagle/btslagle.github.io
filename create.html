        <p id="pc1">My creativity comes in many forms. I enjoy writing, music, inventing and problems solving. I am most happy and alive when I am in creative flow. I want to demonstrate my creative process with a concept for a haunted house attraction that I have created called “Corridors”. My love for the mysterious, whimsical and spooky began at an early age.

                <p>
                    First, I thought of a core concept. Fear comes in many forms. I chose the image of a closed door with light emanating from the cracks around the door. This image symbolizes the world of possibilities that lies beyond the door.</p>

                    <p>A door is a barrier. A door can serve to keep someone out or to contain something within. A Corridor is a long passage filled with doors and possibilities. Be careful which doors you chose to open.

                <img src="Corridors.jpg" alt="A sketch of Corridors haunted attraction">
            </div>
            <div class="text-col"> 
                <p>I decided that I wanted the layout of the attraction to be a reoccurring set of corridors. I made a rough sketch to define the pathway around the haunt. </p>
                <p>I sectioned it into a staging area, themed rooms and mazes that would lead between the themed rooms. Upon entry, guests are greeted in the staging area at the beginning of a long open hallway that ends in at a set of elevator doors. Numerous doors line the hallway that lead to dead ends, frights and the entrance to the next themed section.
                </p>
                <p>
                This staging area is the key element to the attraction.  It will be recreated three times throughout the haunt. The themed areas return the guests to a new staging area. They pass through a door in the same position as the original entrance. This creates a feeling of being caught in a loop they can not escape.  </p>

            <div class="text-col">
            <p>Next, I created the themed sections of the attraction.  The purpose of the themed section is to show what happens when you choose to enter the wrong door.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The first theme was that of a late 1800s hotel based upon the true story of H.H. Holmes. Holmes built hotel rooms and converted them in to traps that executed his victims. Rooms here feature a gas chamber, incinerator and chute that leads to a torture chamber in the basement.</p>
            
            <p>The second theme was a hospital theme based upon the true story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cullen" target="_blank">Charles Cullen</a> a nurse that murdered up to 40 of his patients. Rooms here depect various forms of intential medical malfeasance.</p>

                        The final section of the haunt is a twisted reality escape from the attraction. This section of the haunt will incorporate illusions, obstacles, props and blacklight paint. The idea is to have a disorienting path and create a sense of urgency to escape. </p>
                        
                        <p>The attraction ends back in the staging area. The elevator doors are open. A glowing exit sign is in the elevator.  The final scene is a giant monster emerging from the elevator and charing toward the guests. The lights turn off as the monster shrieks and runs toward the guests. The sound is intense as it approaches. The lights turn back on and the monster is gone. The lights then  flash off and the monster is behind the guest and scares them to the exit. </p>
